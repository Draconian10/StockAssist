    "Here, we are searching for authentic sources of data which will be useful for analyzing stock market data. These sources need to be verified in order to generate an accurate analysis upon the stocks. First of all, these multiple data sources need to be scraped in the format available. Once we obtain all the data from multiple data sources, this raw data is supposed to be refined into content or formats better suited for consumption for our database. Finally, this data is cleaned by detecting corrupt or inaccurate records from the dataset and then replacing, modifying or deleting this coarse data. "
